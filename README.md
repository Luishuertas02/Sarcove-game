# Sarcove-game

Sarcov is a platform game with a theme related to the COVID-19 pandemic, where Lily wakes up the day after her grandmother's funeral. Her parents are somewhat sick, so she decides to go to school alone, without knowing the adventure that awaits her on the way and how her life and the whole world around her will change forever, as a silent and almost imperceptible enemy lurks. Sarscov is a platform game based on the life of Lily, a girl who unknowingly carries a deadly virus that will gradually end the lives of those around her. This virus will destroy the world she knows, immersing her life in a breathtaking adventure where she will have to learn to control her situation to protect herself and her allies, and thus find a way back home.

This game was developed as a university project for the applied practice course, and all its content, such as characters, code, scenarios, and animations, were created by the workgroup.
